To preview html file from here in github:
go to repo with the html file you want to view

click on the html filename
--> it will come up in code, not to worry. 

copy the url
go here in your browser -->    https://htmlpreview.github.io/
paste the url

Expect ==>  you should see the html file open as a formatted document
Actual ==>  works for me
